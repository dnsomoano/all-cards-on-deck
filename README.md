# title: All Cards on Deck! #
In this project, you will use JavaScript to model a deck of playing cards. You'll also add functionality to it such as shuffling and dealing.

Shuffling Cards

Computers are notoriously bad at random numbers. This is a pretty deep and complex topic, but it's worth pointing out that most random numbers we use in computing are actually "pseudorandom". For this assignment, you will read about, then implement, a popular algorithm that shuffles the order of a finite set using JavaScript's built in Math.random() function as a pseudorandom number generator.

Objectives
* Demonstrate usage of JavaScript objects and arrays to model resources
* Understand and implement algorithms
* Create an event-driven user interface
Requirements
- - - - - - -
* Your deck should contain 52 unique cards.
* All cards should have a "rank" and a "suit".
* There are four suits: "Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", and "Spades".
* There are 13 ranks: "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", and "King".
You will model these in code, in any way you see fit. It may require you to experiment and try a number of techniques. There are many valid solutions. Your user interface should consist of a face down deck, and a face up "hand" of cards that have been dealt.

Read about, and implement the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle algorithm:

For our purposes, ```n``` is ```52```:
```
for i from 0 up to n - 1 do:
 j = random integer less than i
 swap items[i] with items[j]
```
Explorer Mode
- [X] The deck should be randomly shuffled when the page is loaded.
- [X] Clicking on the deck should deal a single card, making it visible in the face up hand.
Adventure Mode
- [ ] Implement a way to deal cards into two or more hands
Epic Mode
- [ ] Implement the game of War

A Hint on Random Numbers
This snippet will give you a random integer, ```z``` between ```0``` and ```n```:
```
const z = Math.floor(Math.random() * n)
```
Let's break this down from the inside out:
1. For this example, assume n is 20.
2. We use Math.random() to generate a floating-point number between 0 and 1. Let's assume our random value is 0.42.
3. Multiply that number by n. If we think of this random value as a percentage, multiplying these gives us a number that is some "percentage" of n. Their product is 8.4, or 42% of n.
4. We use Math.floor() to round down to the nearest whole number, i.e. 8.
Because we're rounding down, it's impossible to get 20. This will give us an integer between 0 and 19. This technique is perfect for finding a "random" index in an array of length n.
